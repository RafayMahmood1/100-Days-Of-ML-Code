## Day 4 - Decision Trees

- This code shows basic implementation of Random Forest of Car dataset
- Initially, dataset is checked for any missing values and basic EDA is performed.
- Applied Random Forest Classifier and calculated the accuracy
- Initially default Random Forest classifier was applied which only compute on the basis of 10 trees
- Another implementation was done using 100 tress n_estimators=100
