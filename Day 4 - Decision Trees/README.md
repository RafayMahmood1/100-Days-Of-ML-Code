## Day 4 - Decision Trees

- This code shows basic implementation of Decision Trees on Diabetes dataset
- Initially, dataset is checked for any missing values and basic EDA is performed.
- Applied DecisonTree Classifier and calculated the accuracy
- Accuracy was further increased using max_depth parameter to no overfit the model
